The goal is to minimize total costs related to raw material holding and ordering, considering demand, holding costs, and ordering costs over a specified time period. Decision variables include order quantity, with parameters like demand, holding cost, ordering cost, initial inventory, storage capacity, and time period.\nTo solve this optimization problem two algorithms are applied: Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Sequential Quadratic Programming with Linear Programming and Equality Constraints (SLPSQP). GA, inspired by evolution principles, iteratively refines solutions to find optimal order quantities while SLPSQP uses a mathematical programming approach, considering constraints.\nSeparate optimization runs with both algorithms are conducted, comparing their performance in terms of total cost minimization, convergence speed, computational efficiency, and solution quality. Results show that GA excels in exploring diverse solutions, while SLPSQP demonstrates precision with fewer iterations. The comparison provides insights into exploration-exploitation trade-offs.\nThis research contributes to inventory management by showcasing the applicability and performance of GA and SLPSQP in addressing real-world raw material optimization challenges for a water bottling company.

The robotic arm, initially designed using SolidWorks, was translated into a Simscape model for simulation purposes. Two distinct optimization algorithms, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization\n(ACO), were employed to fine-tune the PID controller gains, aiming to enhance the system’s dynamic performance and stability. The optimized PID gains obtained from simulations were then applied to a physical prototype of the robotic manipulator, which was 3D printed based on the SolidWorks design. The coding and real-time implementation of the PID controllers were conducted using MATLAB.\nProblem statement The optimization of the PID controller using Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Optimization aims to address the laborious nature of manual PID tuning method.\nThese evolutionary and swarm intelligence-based algorithms offer the potential to efficiently explore the vast parameter space, leading to improved controller performance, robustness, and adaptability. The primary challenge lies in achieving optimal\nPID controller parameters for the 5 DOF robotic arm to ensure precise, responsive, and stable control. While current studies often utilize individual nature-inspired optimization algorithms for tuning PID controllers, there is a gap in the literature regarding a comprehensive comparison of the trade-offs and effectiveness of these algorithms specifically applied to a 5-DOF robotic manipulator. This study aims to fill this gap by providing a detailed comparative analysis, ultimately contributing to the development of more efficient and robust control strategies for robotic systems.\nCost of implementation of both algorithms to PID control Upon comparison, it was observed that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) exhibited faster convergence and ran more efficiently than the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm.\nMore details of the project and results (graphs) are documented in the report ","date":1718409600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1731370107,"objectID":"1515c32439c5be54a742ec0a855b0de4","permalink":"https://olorunnisola.netlify.app/project/manipulator_pid_optimization/","publishdate":"2024-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/manipulator_pid_optimization/","section":"project","summary":"Smart Control for Precision in Robotic Manipulators","tags":["Optimization","Control systems","Robotics"],"title":"Meta-Heuristic Optimization Algorithms Based PID Controller Design For A 5-DOF Robotic Manipulator","type":"project"},{"authors":["Adeleke Olorunnisola Oyeyemi"],"categories":null,"content":"This project highlights a comparative analysis of Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers, commonly used in robotics due to their simplicity and effectiveness.
