I am a data scientist with a passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems. I am a graduate from Shiv Nadar University, India. I majored in Computer Science Engineering with a minor in Economics.

Currently, I am working as a Data Analyst with the Global Capacity and Contact Management team at [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/).

Previously, I was working as a research intern with the [Inria-Modal Group](https://www.inria.fr/en) to identify and isolate the causes of suicides in Nord-Pas de Calais region in France using statistical modelling and spatial econometrics. Last summer I worked as a [Data Science for Social Good fellow](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/) at the University of Warwick in collaboration with the German Federal Minsitry for Economic Affairs (BMWi)

When I am not in front of a computer screen, I enjoy hiking to remote lands and cycling. I am always open to a match of lawn tennis or badminton. You can often find me reading Jeffrey Archer or humming to The Lumineers. I love indie and rock music ♪. You can know me better from my [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/55TKQygNmJjb38rjaDZ3NN?si=luxTkgeqRxC9rrDT4Mhe3A). In my last, Myers-Briggs personality test, I tested as [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality).
