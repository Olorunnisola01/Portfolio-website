abstract: This review paper aims to analyze the theoretical foundations of smart manufacturing and its impact on production processes, particularly in the domains of robotics and additive manufacturing, across past, present, and future time horizons. It also explores the potential of smart manufacturing to improve the precision of manufacturing processes, as well as the challenges it poses to the manufacturing sector. This overview will deepen our understanding of modern manufacturing practices. It's worth noting that some scientific developments and technological tools discussed here can be applied to a wider range of automated systems beyond the manufacturing sector. As such, this paper offers valuable insights for those involved in automated system design and implementation.
