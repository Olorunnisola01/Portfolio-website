abstract: This research presents a comprehensive study on the development and application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for advanced path tracking and stabilization in autonomous mobile robots, utilizing both linearized kinematic and dynamic models. The mobile robot is modeled using a bicycle model, capturing its essential motion dynamics. These models are linearized at specific operating points to simplify control design while preserving system behavior near those points. Linear MPC controllers are designed for both the linearized kinematic and dynamic models, ensuring robust performance in two key tasks: set point stabilization and tracking a sinusoidal trajectory. The MPC effectively adjusts control inputs—velocity, steering angle, and yaw dynamics—to minimize tracking errors and achieve smooth stabilization. Results demonstrate that the proposed controllers successfully enable precise trajectory following and stabilization, providing a strong foundation for real-time navigation and control of autonomous mobile robots in dynamic environments.
