abstract: The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate a prototype remotely controlled quadcopter with a battery of 850mAh using locally sourced material. The quadcopter was tested and a flight time of 100secs with extra payload of about 40g was achieved. In achieving this, a frame which is the major body of this project is designed and fabricated putting into consideration the weight, strength, and flexibility of the frame and landing skid that can accommodate shock generated while landing the aircraft. MATLAB software was used for few simulations of the Roll, Pitch and Yaw of the flight controller. The developed quadcopter was tested and it met the performance requirements it was designed for.The main problem in quadcopter is the balancing and stability system. Most of quadcopter will be unbalance and loose stability in case there are direct disturbance on it such as wind. In this project design, a stable design with light-weighted frame but high strength to weight ratio was designed and constructed.Material selection for this drone (project) was thoroughly be analyzed to achieve a more stable system.
