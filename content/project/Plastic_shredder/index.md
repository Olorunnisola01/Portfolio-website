TThis project involves the conceptual design of a shredder for waste management. It focuses solely on creating a practical and efficient design, detailing component selection, blade configuration, and structural layout. The project emphasizes accurate design measurements and specifications without incorporating analysis, simulations, or prototyping. The goal is to outline a clear and functional design concept suitable for future development.
