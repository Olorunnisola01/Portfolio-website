Visual Odometry (VO) is the process of estimating a robotâ€™s position and orientation by analyzing sequential images captured by its on-board cameras. It is a crucial technique in robotics, computer vision and autonomous navigation, as it enables motion tracking without relying on external references like GPS. This project aims to study various processes involved in VO and document the result obtained after implementation of monocular VO using python programming language (simulation environment).
